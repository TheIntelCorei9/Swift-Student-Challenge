# The Particle Binder
'The Particle Binder' - Winning WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge submission!

Welcome to The Particle Binder, the particle accelerator developed to run inside your device!

Your goal is to create a large element by collecting as many protons and neutrons from the accelerator as you can within 20 seconds. Collecting a particle is as easy as tapping it, but watch out - these particles decay and disappear quick, so they might be hard to tap on time!
        
Your accelerator will take your extracted particles to create up to 16 different elements - each requiring their own amount of protons and neutrons to form. The largest element you've made will be saved for you to see where you're up to in your element discovery task.
        
Have fun!
